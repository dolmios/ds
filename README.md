# @dolmios/ds

A straight-forward Next + Stitches component library for bootstrapping projects, and eventually a library to support others with getting their project off the ground. This is a work in progress, but is currently used in a few production projects, so it's stable-ish.

    $ yarn add @dolmios/ds

### Develop

    $ yarn watch (microbundle - watch)
    $ yarn playground (parcel)
    $ yarn lint (eslint)
    $ yarn prettier (prettier)

### Build

    $ yarn build (microbundle - build)
